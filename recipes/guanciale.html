    <p> Cured meats </p> 
    <br>
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 Large Hog Jowl, skin on </li>
      <li> Instacure No. 2 </li>
      <li> Kosher salt </li>
      <li> 1.3 cup sugar</li>
      <li> 1 tablespoon garlic poweder</li>
      <li> 1 table spoon cdrushed balck peppers</li> 
      <li> 2 teaspoons dried thyme</li>   
      <li> 1 teaspoon ground allspice</li>  '
      <li> 5 or 6 bay leaves crushed</li> 
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2> Instructions </h2>
    <ol>
      <li> Mix all the cure ingredients together and pack the jowl with it. Massage the cure into the meat and fat. Put the jowl into a container (plastic, glass, ceramic, stainless steel) that just barely holds it, and toss in any remaining cure. Cover the container and put in the fridge for 4 to 7 days. Turn the jowl over once a day.</li>
      <br>
      <li> When the meat has stiffened up at the thickest part, usually 5 days or more, rinse off the cure (you can leave a little on, but get most off), and pat the jowl dry. Put on a rack in a drafty place for several hours.    </li>
      <br>
      <li> Poke a hole through the skin on a corner of the jowl and tie string to it. Hang the jowl in a cool, moist place (50-55Â°F and at least 65 percent humidity, but see above for more curing instructions) for at least 3 weeks before eating. To store, cut into large chunks and vacuum seal or cover with plastic wrap and butcher paper before freezing. Guanciale will last, well-wrapped, in the fridge for several months.</li>
